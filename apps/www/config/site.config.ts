    desc: `Computers used to be magical. But much of that magic has been lost over time, replaced by subpar tools and practices that slow teams down and hold back great work. Frustrated with the status quo, we decided to build something better. Something that teams would actually enjoy using. We named it Linear to signify progress.
What started as a simple issue tracker, has since evolved into a powerful project and issue tracking system that streamlines workflows across the entire product development process. We don’t think of Linear as just a better “tool”, but as a better “way” to build software.`,
