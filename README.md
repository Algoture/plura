## 🚀 Introduction

Plura is a revolutionary SaaS platform that redefines AI-powered communication and interaction. Our innovative solution allows you to create intelligent "brains" - custom AI agents that can be trained with specific information and connected across multiple communication channels.

## 🌈 Powered by Turborepo

### Why Turborepo?

Plura leverages Turborepo to create a cutting-edge, highly efficient monorepo architecture that provides:

- **Unprecedented Build Speed**: Turborepo's intelligent caching reduces build and development times
- **Consistent Tooling**: Unified configurations across all project packages
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy management of multiple applications and shared components
- **Remote Caching**: Efficient build artifact sharing across development and CI/CD environments

### Monorepo Structure

Our project is organized into multiple packages and applications:

- `apps/web`: Main Plura web application
- `apps/docs`: Documentation site
- `packages/ui`: Shared React component library
- `packages/eslint-config`: Standardized linting configurations
- `packages/typescript-config`: Centralized TypeScript configurations
- `packages/ai-brain`: Core AI brain logic and utilities
- `packages/integrations`: Communication channel connectors

## 🌟 Core Vision

Plura empowers businesses and individuals to create intelligent, context-aware AI agents that can seamlessly interact across various platforms, breaking down communication barriers and providing personalized, intelligent responses.

## 🔑 Key Features
